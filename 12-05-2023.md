# 12 May Challenge

Answer: "i love angelhack code challenge because it is fun and exciting and i dislike the word yab that appears in the phrase"

Note 1 (to explain my final answer): 

The string 11111111110001 can represent a space character, or when broken up into 3 pieces 1111111111, 00, and 01, represents the nonsensical and dislikable word *yab*.  There are 3 such strings appearing between the words "word" and "that" in the phrase, and so we interpret the middle string to represent *yab* while the other two represent spaces.

*yab* appears underlyingly in every phrase of more than 1 word since it has the same representation as the space character.  But if it appears in the surface form as *yab*, it almost always messes up the decoding of the phrase.  So while it is a valid word according to the codebook, it is an undesirable word.  This explains why it is reasonable to say that *yab* appears in the given phrase and the speaker dislikes the word.

Note 2: 

The quote marks are not part of the answer.  They are there to show there are no leading or trailing spaces in the answer string.
